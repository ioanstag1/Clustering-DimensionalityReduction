# Clustering-DimensionalityReduction

This repository is related to Pattern Recognition course purposes at ECE, DUTH.


In this project, I explored clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques through hands-on exercises with the Seeds Dataset and city air distances. I experimented with k-means clustering, assessing optimal cluster counts using the silhouette coefficient, and explored normalization effects. I also delved into PCA and LDA for feature reduction, enhancing data visualization, and utilized classical MDS to spatially represent data.
